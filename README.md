# Mono2Micro

Tools to migrate a monolith to a microservices architecture, focusing on microservices identification, where the set of identified microservices minimizes the number of system transactions (microservices) associated with a business transaction, aiming to control introduction of relaxed consistency in the system.

Currently implemented for systems that use the FÃ©nixFramework ORM and Spring-Boot, but can be generalized for any monolith technology.
